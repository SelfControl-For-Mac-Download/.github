## About SelfControl For Mac

SelfControl for Mac is a productivity-focused application that blocks access to distracting websites and applications for a user-defined time. Whether you’re studying, working remotely, or just need a digital detox, SelfControl keeps you on track.

Unlike browser extensions or soft blockers, SelfControl makes it nearly impossible to cheat the system. Once you start a session, it continues even if you restart your computer or delete the app. It edits your host firewall directly for maximum effectiveness.

The interface is minimal: just set a timer, choose what to block (via blacklist or whitelist), and press Start. From that point forward, those distractions are gone until the timer hits zero.

Perfect for students, freelancers, and digital workers who struggle with online distractions, SelfControl is one of the simplest yet most powerful focus tools available for macOS.
